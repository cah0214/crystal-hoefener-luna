        <h4>Hello! My name is Crystal, and I'm a mother, a student, and a proud dog mom to my best friend, Kane. My journey has taken me from the fast-paced world of logistics to the compassionate field of health sciences, but I've recently discovered a new and exciting passion: coding.

            I am currently a student at Excelsior University, where I'm working towards my Associate's degree in Health Sciences. I've also embarked on an incredible new adventure with Code the Dream, where I'm learning to code from the ground up. This website is my very first personal portfolio, where I hope to bridge the two worlds I'm passionate about: the analytical problem-solving of logistics and the creative logic of coding.
            
            This space is for me to share my progress, showcase my growing skills, and demonstrate that a passion for learning has no limits. It's a testament to the idea that with hard work and dedication, you can build a new path, no matter where you start.
